At La Tavola Calda, we believe in the art of simplicity and the beauty of tradition. Our carefully curated pizza menu, featuring just four exquisite varieties, is a testament to our commitment to quality over quantity. Each pizza represents a distinct aspect of Italian culinary heritage, crafted with the freshest ingredients and the utmost care.

We offer four pizzas: Margherita, Salami, Quattro Formaggi, Marshmallow

Pizza Margherita - The Classic Perfection: Paying homage to the colors of the Italian flag, our Margherita is a blend of ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil. It's a timeless classic that lets the purity and freshness of the ingredients shine through.

Pizza Salami - The Flavorful Journey: For those who crave a bit of zest, our Salami pizza offers a spicy kick. The robust flavors of cured Italian salami are balanced by the mellow mozzarella, making every bite a bold experience.

Pizza Quattro Formaggi - The Cheese Lover’s Dream: A quartet of Italian cheeses, each lending its unique texture and taste, comes together for a pizza that’s sumptuously indulgent. It’s a melody of flavors that cheese aficionados will savor down to the last slice.

Marshmallow Pizza - The Sweet Innovation: Embracing both tradition and creativity, this dessert pizza is a delightful surprise. It blends the warmth of toasted marshmallows with a rich chocolate sauce, creating a dessert that's unforgettably indulgent.

By focusing on just four pizzas, we dedicate our time to perfect each one. We invest in sourcing the highest quality ingredients and spend hours perfecting the dough and sauce. This allows us to ensure that every pizza served is not just a meal but an authentic Italian experience. At La Tavola Calda, each pizza is not just cooked; it's crafted with passion and served with pride.
